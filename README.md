# Possum-Age-Regression
The dataset I have worked with contains information on the physical characteristics, age and whereabouts of Australian possums. I was working on creating a model that would predict the age of the animal based on it's features. The root mean square error value of my model is 1.739 with standard deviation of age equal to 1.915. This linear regression model does poorly on outliers. Nevertheless, it is a valuable experience for me.
